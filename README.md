# Personal Blog

## Description

This project was built in order to create a two-page website where users will input and view blog posts. It includes building a content form, dynamically rendering blog posts, and implementing a light/dark mode toggle. Creating this blog allowed me to understand the power of Document Object Models, communication between peers to learn from each other and the power of search engines when using the correct key terms. Through this project, I learnt to:
- utilise Document Object Models
- setting data attributes in HTML from JS
- retrieving attributes in HTML to JS
- use event listeners
- prevent default behaviour occurring when submitting forms
- store and retrieve information in local storage by utilising JSON methods
- create forms and retrieve information from them
